<p>How can we make data science more accessible? How many peole have tried to learn how to use R or python or SQL and gave up because they were overwhelmed or didn’t know where to start? I certainly know that the first time I was exposed to R, I was completely lost. Yet, there are so many disciplines where having some type of coding and data science experience is extremely useful. This is especially true in the field of biology. My goal with this project is to create a website that future biology students at Willamette can refer to as a starting point when using RStudio. This project stems from Professor David Craig’s SCRP project beginning in the summer of 2021. Professor Craig’s work focuses on the conservation of the habitat of the slender billed white breasted nut hatch, particularly the Oregon White Oak. My project will be the beginning of Professor Craig’s team using data analysis to help conserve these trees and birds.</p>
